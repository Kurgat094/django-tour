            <h2>Gorilla Trekking</h2>
            <p>
                Gorilla trekking remains the number one product for Uganda. It distinguishes Uganda from its main competitors, Kenya and Tanzania. 
                It provides Uganda with an iconic tourism asset. With insecurity in DRC and expensive permits in Rwanda versus demand growth, Uganda enjoys an enviable position. 
                As demand begins to exceed supply, increasing the fee during the high season is justified, making gorilla trekking a world-class experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes improved roads, planned towns, and capacity development for local service providers, using it for extended visits to other parts of the country. 
                In a high season, preference should be given to tourists booking a full 7-14 day trip to Uganda. Through research, options for increasing the supply of permits 
                can be explored through more habituations and conservation of Enchuya Forest into a National Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                There should be no relaxation on the rules governing gorilla trekking (tourists, time, etc.) to maintain its quality. Wildlife safaris complement gorilla trekking, 
                offering tourists a complete and unforgettable experience in Uganda.
            </p>

      <div class="destination col-lg-5 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
        <h2>Safaris in Uganda</h2>
        <p>
            Murchison Falls National Park currently comes first in Uganda for safaris. Though driven by oil extraction, bridge construction will address the ferry issues vs tourist crossing. 
            Take note of potential incompatibility of oil drilling and wildlife tourism and pay utmost attention to environmental protection and safeguarding the needs of the tourism industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being one of the top three iconic tourist attractions in Uganda, Murchison Falls can be further developed by constructing a glass bridge and a high-end facility on top of the falls. 
            Building a dam would lead to product destruction and should be dropped.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anti-poaching efforts, management of human-wildlife conflict, and addressing invasive species are key in Queen Elizabeth National Park. A positive safari experience in Queen Elizabeth National Park 
            will augment hotel investment and associated multiplier effects, further boosting Uganda's tourism industry.
        </p>

    <div class="destination col-lg-5 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
      <h2>Bird Watching in Uganda</h2>
      <p>
          Uganda is blessed with an extraordinary diversity of birds, boasting over 1,000 species. This is certainly an asset to be exploited. 
          Bird watchers tend to visit for longer durations, given the long list of species to be found and the amount of time needed to locate them.
      </p>
      <p>
          Bird guiding is very demanding, requiring skilled guides to meet the expectations of bird watchers. While bird-watching will remain a smaller part of wildlife tourism, 
          it offers a unique and rewarding experience for enthusiasts and contributes to Uganda's diverse tourism offerings.
      </p>

          <div class="destination col-lg-5 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
            <h2>Chimpanzee Trekking in Uganda</h2>
            <p>
                Chimpanzee trekking is an underdeveloped product that needs more attention and can be as rewarding as gorilla trekking. 
                Only 50 forests in Africa offer the potential for chimpanzee trekking, and 20 of them are in Uganda and easily accessible from Kampala.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the locations with chimpanzees are in national forests rather than national parks. This provides a unique opportunity to develop 
                chimpanzee trekking as a key tourism product, further enhancing Uganda's reputation as a top wildlife destination.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination col-lg-5 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
          <h2>Source of the Nile</h2>
          <p>
              One of Ugandaâ€™s iconic attractions is the source of the Nile. It has become a moderately successful hub for adventure tourism, 
              offering activities such as whitewater rafting, bungee jumping, and zip lining.
          </p>
          <p>
              The colourful history of the search for the source of the Nile could support a small museum, but currently, there is not even an information center. 
              Developing such facilities would enhance the visitor experience and further establish the Source of the Nile as a must-visit destination in Uganda.

      <div class=" col-lg-1" ></div>
      <div class="destination col-lg-5 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
        <h2>Rwenzori Mountains</h2>
        <p>
            The Rwenzori Mountains present another tourism opportunity unique to Uganda. It promotes peak trekking, but also offers 1-3 day hikes in the lower altitudes, 
            making it accessible to a wider range of tourists. The breathtaking scenery and unique biodiversity make the Rwenzori Mountains a must-visit destination for adventure seekers.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="destination col-lg-5 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
        <h2>Mount Elgon</h2>
        <p>
            Mount Elgon presents another opportunity more akin to Mount Kilimanjaro. As a large volcano, its summit is much more accessible. 
            Its wildlife, waterfalls, caldera, and caves, combined with uncrowded trails, could be an attractive alternative as Kilimanjaro becomes more and more popular. 
            Mount Elgon offers a unique and serene trekking experience for those looking to explore Uganda's natural beauty.

      <h2>Cultural Tourism in Uganda</h2>
      <p>
          After wildlife, tourists also want to experience cultural tourism. Outside of Kampala, many communities are eager to host tourists for short visits or overnight stays. 
          These cultural experiences provide a unique opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves in Uganda's rich traditions, music, dance, and cuisine, 
          while also supporting local communities and promoting sustainable tourism.

  <div class="destination col-lg-12 col-12 px-2" id="destinations">
      <h2>MICE Tourism in Uganda</h2>
      <p>
          MICE tourism is a new and exciting opportunity for Uganda. Conference organizers are always looking for new locations to provide variety for their participants. 
          With its unique attractions, serene environments, and growing infrastructure, Uganda has the potential to become a preferred destination for meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions. 
          This sector can significantly contribute to the country's tourism growth and economic development.
